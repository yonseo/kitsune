# kitsune
Comic App created with FuelPHP.

Getting Started
1) Start a local server using MAMP or XAMP or your preferred server (I am using mysql and phpMyAdmin).
2) In your browser go to http://localhost/phpMyAdmin
3) In phpMyAdmin Create a database and name it kitsune_db. 
4) Simply import the sql file in phpMyAdmin to the database kitsune_db.

Now you can test the app by uploading your own comic pages and create new books and read them. each comic book has an eye icon to read or a wrench/gear icon to edit.
